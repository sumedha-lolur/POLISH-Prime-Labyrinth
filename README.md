# Prime Labyrinth

## Overview
Prime Labyrinth is a JavaScript-based interactive game where players navigate through various levels of number-mazes within a set time limit. The objective of the game is to find a path of prime numbers from the start to the exit in the given time. There are tiles given in the grids containing either prime or non-prime numbers which are initially white. On clicking the tiles with prime numbers, they are highlighted as right. Tiles with other non-prime numbers are highlighted as wrong on click. There is a timer running and 3 lives available.

The game engages various cognitive skills such as spatial reasoning, decision making and planning, accuracy and mathematical reasoning.

**This is only a prototype of the game which will be developed completely in the later stages**
